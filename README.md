# jointNFT-polygon-hack

A marketplace for NFT funds. Investors invest money into any number of funds. Funds can be managed by NFT Curators or community. Investors participate with experts with shared risk. Curators get to earn a cut from the profit, and invest in more assets.

# Current Standing:

As of the current project, the concept of the NFT fund is completed.

Investors can: 
- View the different funds that are present in the marketplace.
- Invest into a fund and get erc20 fund tokens. 
- Sell their fund tokens back to the fund. 
- View all the NFT's that are present in the fund. 

Fund Managers can:
- Create a fund by depositing a certain amount of MATIC themselfs.
- Use the fund to buy NFT's from opensea as a simulated trade.
- Sell NFT's from the fund in a simulated fashion

Future scope: 
- The investors will be able to see the history of the fund. 
- Will be able to buy NFT's from the fund directly , thus making it a NFT marketplace in itself.
- Create DAO's
- A centralised wallet management service will need to be built to work with the existing marketplaces to buy and sell NFT's.
- Fund managers will be able to block buying and selling of tokens from the fund. 
- Build a cross chain platform in such a way that it can buy and sell NFT's from other chains. Ex; ethereum.
